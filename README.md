## Abstract--
Time series analysis has gained prominence as an increasingly utilized tool for forecasting stock market values. This strategy leverages historical pricing and patterns to predict future market behavior. By examining previous data, time series models can unveil patterns and trends in the stock market, enabling accurate forecasting of future values. Given the significant impact of equity markets on individuals and national economies, the ability to effectively anticipate stock movements can mitigate investment risk and enhance profitability. In this study, we employ the Time Series Forecasting approach to anticipate and visualize stock market outcomes. Our projection is based on a technical examination of historical data using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Widely recognized for its resilience, efficiency, and short-term prediction capabilities in the banking and economics sectors, the ARIMA model serves as a robust tool for forecasting stock market movements.
